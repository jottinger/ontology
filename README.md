# ontology
Test Project for Ontology Modeling in Scala

This is a project with which I can model a data structure as an ontology.

The structure is simple, with six elements:

1. A person.
1. An employee is a person.
1. A person has a birth date.
1. A person has a name.
1. A name has a first name, which is a string.
1. A name has a last name, which is a string.

There is a sample file in the testing resources, which shows a general target for the output, although there are aspects the sample does not include.
